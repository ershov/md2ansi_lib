# written inside one of them is styled instead of leaking its literal `#`s.
#
# How it works: the block rule (list/blockquote) claims the whole block first
# and draws its own chrome (the bullet, or the `│` bar); it then recurses the
# *leftover* line content through this context, where the `^#{1,6} ` heading
# rules fire per line (the engine compiles with re.MULTILINE) exactly as they
# do at top level. Going *through* the block formatter is what preserves the
# chrome — a sibling top-level heading rule cannot, because the block rules
# consume their own lines first (a flat heading rule placed beside `list` either
# no-ops on multi-line lists or eats the bullet on single-line ones).
#
# Covered: a heading that is the direct line-content of a list item or a
# blockquote line — `- ## h`, `1. ## h`, `> ## h`, multi-line quotes, and
# headings in nested list items (`- a` then `  - ## h`), with inline emphasis
# in the title still rendered.
#
# NOT covered (each would require real recursive block parsing, which this
# regex engine does not do): a heading on a marker-less list *continuation*
# line (`- a` then `  ## h` — the `_MD_LIST` grammar never captures that line
# into the list block), and multi-level block nesting such as a list inside a
# quote (`> - ## h`, where the blockquote recurses into this context, which has
# no list rule).
#
# Deliberately distinct from M2A_CONTEXT_MD_INLINE: INLINE stays heading-free
# because it also renders heading titles and table cells, where a literal
# `## x` must survive untouched.
